## 🎨 Design Philosophy

This redesign embodies **unixporn aesthetics**:

1. **Functional beauty** - Every element serves a purpose
2. **Terminal aesthetic** - Command-line inspired throughout
3. **Dark mode first** - Easy on the eyes
4. **Monospace typography** - For terminal elements
5. **Clean hierarchy** - Information architecture that breathes
6. **Your personality** - Not a template, sounds like YOU

---

## 💡 What Makes This Different

### Before (Antigravity):
Generic portfolio. Could be anyone. No personality. Corporate vibes.

### After (This):
- **Your voice** throughout
- **Your values** explicit (community accountability, decolonial practice)
- **Your story** clear (CS → MBA → Film makes sense)
- **Your community work** central (not hidden)
- **Your aesthetics** reflected (terminal/unixporn)
- **Your humor** present (teaching machines to read bodies while films misread archives)

---
