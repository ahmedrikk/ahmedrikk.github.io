## About Section

### BEFORE:
> "Interdisciplinary creative technologist combining Computer Science (BS), Marketing (MBA), and Film studies. 5+ years driving measurable marketing results (40% traffic growth, 30% page view increases). Award-winning experimental filmmaker with 15+ international festival selections."

### AFTER:
> "I make films about erased histories that refuse to be translated. I build marketing systems that turn data into narrative. I counsel queer people in places where survival itself is criminalized.
>
> My work sits at the intersection of three seemingly incompatible worlds: **computer science** (COMSATS, Pakistan), **business strategy** (MBA, Concordia), and **experimental cinema** (Indus Valley School of Art). Most people see contradiction. I see methodology.
>
> **The throughline:** I recover what's been suppressed. Whether it's a 300-year-old poet's queerness, a brand's hidden audience, or a teenager's first question about PrEP on Reddit—my work is about making the invisible legible without destroying its illegibility in the process."

**NEW ADDITION:**
> ### Artistic Philosophy
> "How can cinema recover suppressed South Asian queer histories while refusing to translate them for Western consumption?"
>
> My films use **surrealism as epistemology**—not as aesthetic choice but as research methodology. When state archives erase us, when family destroys evidence, when colonial categories fail to contain us, surrealism becomes the only honest form of documentation.

## Film Descriptions

### BEFORE - "Rekhta":
> "2024 | 6:20 min | Experimental Narrative
> Exploring liberation in black-and-white/color."

### AFTER - "Rekhta":
> "Black-and-white confinement meets saturated color liberation. Named after the Urdu poetic form that broke Persian's grammatical chains, the film stages its own formal rebellion—color as escape velocity from monochrome containment.
>
> *Rekhta poetry mixed Urdu with Persian, creating a hybrid language the establishment couldn't control. This film does the same with image: when black-and-white (the colonial gaze) fails to contain the subject, color bleeds through like contraband joy.*"

### BEFORE - "Mann Ki Hastam":
> "2021 | 6:01 min | Surrealist Experimental
> 15+ International Festival Selections"

### AFTER - "Mann Ki Hastam":
> "A fever dream through identity, migration, and the violence of categorization. The title asks Bulleh Shah's question: 'Who am I?' The film refuses to answer. **15+ international festival selections**.
>
> *On the impossibility of self-knowledge when every mirror is colonial, every archive redacted, every family photo censored. The surrealist imagery isn't metaphor—it's documentation of what survival looks like when legibility itself is weaponized.*
>
> [Accolades: 15+ Festivals | 120K+ Views]"

## NEW SECTION: Community Work

### DIDN'T EXIST BEFORE

### AFTER:
> ## Community Work
> *My research doesn't extract from communities—it's accountable to them. This isn't academic tourism. It's survival work.*
>
> ### Reddit LGBTQ+ Peer Counseling
> Active moderator and peer counselor in Pakistani LGBTQ+ communities where queerness is criminalized, families are violent, and institutional support doesn't exist.
>
> **What this looks like:**
> - **Sexual health education:** PrEP access, safer sex practices, harm reduction strategies
> - **Crisis intervention:** First-response support for people experiencing family violence, outing threats, survival emergencies
> - **Mental health support:** Trauma-informed peer counseling, suicide prevention, relationship advice
> - **Practical resources:** How to access hormones, find safe housing, navigate asylum processes
>
> *This work shapes my filmmaking. You can't make honest films about queer South Asian life from a Western academic distance. The questions on Reddit at 3 AM—"Am I going to hell?" "How do I tell my parents?" "What's PrEP?"—those are the questions my films try to answer without answering, hold without resolving.*
>
> **Ethical Framework:** Community accountability, not extraction. Harm reduction, not moral judgment. Survival strategies, not assimilation narratives.

## Impact on Brand Positioning

### BEFORE:
Generic interdisciplinary professional. Could be anyone with CS + MBA + creative interests.

### AFTER:
Specific, memorable, authentic voice. Queer Pakistani filmmaker/activist who happens to code and understand marketing. Makes work accountable to living communities, not extractive Western academia. Uses surrealism as methodology. Refuses to translate queer South Asian experiences for Western consumption.

**Result:** When someone lands on your site, they IMMEDIATELY understand:
1. Who you are
2. What you value
3. Why your interdisciplinary background makes sense
4. What makes you different from every other "creative technologist"
5. Your political/ethical commitments
6. Your community work
7. Your sense of humor and personality
