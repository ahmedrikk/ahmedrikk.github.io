I exist in the spaces people say shouldn't connect:

```bash
CS Degree (COMSATS, Pakistan)
    └─> MBA Marketing (Concordia Chicago)
        └─> Film Diploma (Indus Valley School of Art)
            └─> Award-winning experimental cinema
                └─> Reddit LGBTQ+ peer counseling
                    └─> PhD applications (Visual Arts)
```

Most people ask: *"How does that all fit together?"*

Wrong question.

The contradiction **IS** the methodology.

## 🌍 Values & Principles

### Community Accountability, Not Extraction
My research doesn't study queer South Asians—I'm one of us. My films are accountable to living communities, not dead archives.

### Decolonial Aesthetics
I refuse to translate South Asian queer experiences for Western consumption. If you don't understand without explanation, that's not my failure—it's the point.

### Surrealism as Methodology
When state archives erase us, when families destroy evidence, when colonial categories fail to contain us, surrealism becomes the only honest form of documentation.

### Harm Reduction as Practice
Working-class background. Immigration trauma survivor. Asylum applicant (3+ years pending). I understand precarity. My community work reflects that—meeting people where they are, not where institutions wish they were.

## 💭 Philosophy

> *"I make films about erased histories that refuse to be translated. I build marketing systems that turn data into narrative. I counsel queer people in places where survival itself is criminalized."*

> *"My work sits at the intersection of three seemingly incompatible worlds: computer science, business strategy, and experimental cinema. Most people see contradiction. I see methodology."*

> *"Bulleh Shah asked, 'Who am I?' Patriarchy answered for him. My films ask the question again—and refuse to accept their answer."*

## 🎬 Current Projects

### Bulleyah (Feature Film)
Recovering the erased queer identity of 18th-century Sufi poet Bulleh Shah through experimental cinema. 117-page screenplay, 5 years of development. Practice-based PhD dissertation project.

### PhD Applications (2025-2026)
Applying to fully-funded Visual Arts and Film Studies programs with focus on queer South Asian cinema, decolonial aesthetics, and practice-based research.

### Reddit LGBTQ+ Counseling (Ongoing)
Peer support in Pakistani LGBTQ+ communities. Sexual health education, crisis intervention, harm reduction in criminalized contexts.

### Instagram Film Education (Ongoing)
Teaching accessible film theory. Tarkovsky isn't just for film school kids. You don't need a degree to understand why a film matters.

To the queer Pakistani kids on Reddit who ask questions no one else will answer.
